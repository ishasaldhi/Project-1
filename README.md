Project Description/Outline:
This project aims to leverage data analytics techniques to gain a deeper understanding of melanoma, a potentially life-threatening form of skin cancer. By analyzing large-scale datasets, including clinical, genomic, treatments, mutations, weather, and other demographics.

The goal of this project is to introduce cancer research and explore general trends and correlations with a specific cancer type, melanoma. As the human race progresses in technological advancements (such as cancer treatments), such improvements can also be a hindrance to our health, like processed foods or greenhouse gases skyrocketing the temperature of the earth. Here we will present defining characteristics of melanoma-affected populations, explore primary vs metastatic melanoma differences, look at tumor characteristics and treatment outcomes, as well as dig deeper to look at more subtle correlations and causes, such as the affect of treatment costs on mortality and how region and weather play a part in melanoma prognosis. Ultimately we wish to educate individuals on what melanoma is and what are the major trends we see affecting the US population regarding this cancer. 

CSV datasets used can be found within the main branch, as well as our jupyter notebook 'Project_1_Melanoma' and presentation 'Project 1".

Research Questions to Answer:
1. What are some of the trends of Melanoma in terms of incidences, age and ethnicity that can help us to better understand this cancer.
2.
3. How expensive is melanoma treatment in comparison to other cancers? Is its cost a different financial burden amongst different racial/SES populations, and does that influence mortality rates?
4. What are the regional percentanges of Melanoma staging and what is the progression and spread of the disease.
 

Datasets Used:
* NCI SEERS database
* NCI GDC database
