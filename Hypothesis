Hypothesis
  null hypothesis p-value <= 0.5? --> significance 


create data based on latitude and longitude?

hard to do it based on state

t-test --> significance of different between 2 groups -> independent or one sample(from standard population)


t-test between data from two different years?

Hypothesis 1 -- maybe look at correlation between location and incidence of melanoma
--> test by choosing two different years and find the correlations for each year
--> find correlations between Latidude and the incidence of Melanoma
--> find correlation between Latidude and the Temperature


Secondary Hypothesis -- look at correlation between year and incidence of melanoma
--> compare the results from the two years --> potential t-test?
